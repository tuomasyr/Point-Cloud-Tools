## Disclaimer
This is a readme document for the users of automatic point cloud processing tools to characterize trees initially developed and described in detail in Yrttimaa et al. ([2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11121423), [2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.08.017)). The tools have been implemented in [MATLAB](https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) but the workflow requires the user to also have an [R statistical software](https://www.r-project.org/) and a licensed [LAStools software](https://rapidlasso.com/) installed on the computer. The tools can be used free of charge under the [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Appropriately citing the original research articles as well as this document is preferred when used within academia. No guarantees or technical support related to the use and applicability of the tools are provided by default. For scientific or commercial cooperation, please contact the author.

## Contents
The point cloud processing tools consist of a main script (mainscript.m) and a group of functions (see Table 1) executed subsequently to:
1) import point cloud data (pc_import_las.m),
2) detect tree crown segments (pc_detect_trees_chm.m),
3) extract point clouds for individual trees or groups of trees (pc_tree_extraction.m),
4) classify individual tree point clouds into stem and non-stem points (pc_classify), and
5) compute tree metrics for each tree (pc_treeMetrics.m, compute_treemetrics.m). 

As an input, the tools require a single height-normalized point cloud representing the tree community of interest. By default, the functions read .las-files that can be obtained from practically any point cloud file format using the open source tools of LAStools software. The height normalization procedure can be carried out using the LAStools software and following the workflow presented in e.g. Ritter et al. (2017). 

As an output, the point cloud processing tools return for each tree, identified by a treeID number: 
1) a classified point cloud with stem points and non-stem points separated, 
2) a stem taper curve (i.e. diameters along the stem from base to top of the tree)
3) figures to illustrate point cloud classification and stem taper curve estimation
3) cylinder models representing the stem dimensions and volume,
4) tree metrics, or attributes characterizing the tree properties such as the XY-location, diameter (dbh) and basal area (ba) at the breast height, tree height (h), stem volume (vol), diameter at 6 m height d6), diameter at 50% of tree height (d05), logwood volume (vlog, i.e. volume of the stem section with diameter > 15 cm) and pulpwood volume (vpulp i.e. volume of the stem section with diameter < 15 cm but > 8 cm).

The point cloud processing tools have been designed to process one multi-scan terrestrial laser scanning point cloud covering a sample plot of 32 m x 32 m in size, including a variety of different-sized trees. Performance of the point cloud-based methods have been investigated in southern boreal forests, and extensive investigations of its feasibility in characterizing trees is summarized in [Yrttimaa (2021)](https://doi.org/10.14214/df.314). When applied outside the southern boreal forest zone, the user may need to adjust some of the computing parameters. 

## Description of the contents

- **mainscript.m**
Define parameter values, directories, and filenames, run the processing functions.

- **pc_import_las.m**
Import height-normalized terrestrial laser scanning point cloud data as .las-format and extract point cloud extent. This function uses the [lasdata.m](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48073-lasdata) function (Kumpumäki 2021) to read .las files.

- **pc_detect_trees_chm.m**
Detect tree crown segments to partition the point cloud into smaller parts in a meaningful way. This requires the user to have R statistical software and required packages ‘[raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html)’, ‘[ForestTools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ForestTools/index.html)’, ‘[rgdal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html)’, and ‘[sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html)’. Crown segmentation is carried out in R using a simple canopy height model (CHM) -based approach employing variable window filtering (Popescu and Wynne 2004) and marker-controlled watershed segmentation (Meyer and Beucher 1990). The related R script **detect_trees_chm.R** is there for that purpose. The user needs to ensure that the correct spatial reference system (epsg) is used. The [lascanopy](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/lascanopy/)-tool from the LAStools software is used for generating the related CHM (see **lastools.m**). Outputs crown segment polygons.

- **pc_tree_extraction.m**
Delineate the sample plot point cloud based on the detected crown segments using the point-in-polygon approach. This uses the [lasclip](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/lasclip/)-tool from the LAStools software and outputs .las-files of individual trees.

- **pc_classify.m**
This function executes the point cloud classification for each individual tree point cloud. It is an iterative procedure beginning from the base of the tree and proceeding towards the tree top, aiming at separating points representing the tree stem (i.e., stem points) from points not representing the tree stem (i.e., non-stem points). Smooth, cylindrical and vertical surfaces with vertical continuity are the point cloud characteristics that are to distinct a tree stem from branches and foliage. For more details, see [Yrttimaa et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.08.017). Outputs stem points and crown points as .txt-files for each tree. The LAStools software can be used to merge tree-wise extracted point clouds together.
 
 - **pc_treeMetrics.m**
Loops through all the detected trees and uses the function **compute_treemetrics.m** to extract tree metrics (i.e. XY-location, diameter and the basal area at the breast height, tree height, stem volume) for each tree. 

- **compute_treemetrics.m**
Tree metrics for each extracted tree is computed using this function. It uses the function [CircleFitByTaubin.m](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22678-circle-fit-taubin-method) (Chernov 2021) to fit circles into horizontal point cloud slices to measure stem cross-section diameters. Taper curve is stored for each tree to quantify its characteristics. For more details, see [Yrttimaa et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11121423).

- **lastools.m**
This function enables the user to run LAStools commands on MATLAB. User’s own LAStools bin directory must be defined in order to use this function.

- **myfunctions.m**
Contains some functions to be used in the data processing workflow.
